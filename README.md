# OVC Comprehensive Data Quality Dashboard

**Live App:** [https://sufuri.shinyapps.io/ovc_gaps/](https://sufuri.shinyapps.io/ovc_gaps/)

## Overview

The **OVC Gaps Dashboard** is an interactive R Shiny application designed to support monitoring and evaluation efforts in Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) programs. The dashboard provides real-time insights into regsitry gaps, reporting eligibility, HIV status monitoring, data quality, and prevention program performance.

Built with R Shiny, the application enables stakeholdersâ€”such as implementing partners, M&E officers, program managers, and case managers interactively explore data, assess program performance, and identify areas for action or improvement.

## âœ¨ Key Features

### 1. **Eligible for Reporting**
This section summarizes the population that is eligible for reporting, providing a clear snapshot of:

- **Enrolled OVCs**
- **Birth Certificate Ownership**
- **OVCs with Disabilities**
- **Exited Beneficiaries**
- **Transferred Beneficiaries**

These metrics help validate the reporting base and provide insight into the dynamics of the OVC program beneficiaries.

### 2. **HIV Information**
Focused on HIV-positive OVCs, this section tracks and analyzes clinical outcomes and care cascade, including:

- **Viral Load Cascade**
- **Contribution to the Triple 95 Targets**
- **HIV-Positive OVC Enrollment Trends**
- **Unsuppressed Viral Load Trends**

This supports targeted interventions and helps programs meet PEPFAR clinical targets.

- **Inconsistencies in registration data**
- **Coverage gaps by service area or demographics**

This ensures that decisions are made on the basis of complete and reliable data.

### 4. **OVC Preventive (Sinovuyo EBI)**
Tracks the implementation and performance of the **Sinovuyo Parenting Program** (an evidence-based intervention):

- **Enrollment Trends**
- **Session Completion Rates**
- **Session Gaps** (e.g. skipped sessions, duplicates, inconsistent sessions)

By analyzing these metrics, stakeholders can strengthen EBI delivery, improve retention, and reduce fidelity issues.
